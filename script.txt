We'll be looking at QECCs, in particular, the transformation between QECCs, using the tool of ZX calculus.

This work was jointly done by Sarah, Lia and me, with tons of constructive feedback from our supervisors Alels, Michele, and Michael



To start, I'd like to give you a quick overview of this talk, so that you can have a brief idea of what you can expect in the next 40 minutes.

In the study of QECCs, there are just so many codes. For example, you have ...

To make things worse, even for one particular code, you can have different representations. For example, for the steane code...

Now, it seems that we are dealing with a giant table, where you have...

Appearently, this table makes it very difficult for us to make systematic argument.

If fact, different codes may prefer different representations. For example, topological codes may prefer geometry representation, while LDPCs may prefer tanner graph.

To this end, the community has been trying to unify these different representations. One very successful approach is the ZX diagram, thanks to the contribution of every one of us here in this meeting room.





Now, I think I'll need to use the next 15 minutes to set the ground. That is, to define all the necessary notions and notations in quantum error correction. If you have never came across qec before, you can take it as a crush course on qec.

The fundamental concept under qecs is the stabilizers, which, in principles, can just be any Abelian n-qubit Pauli subgroup. But of course, if you want nice error correcting properties, you usually want a wise choice of the stabilizers.


Now, linear albegra gives us a very simple but important relation between these two sets.



The encoder is an isometry from a lower qubit hilber space, to a subset of a larger qubit hilber space.
